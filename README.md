# SortingVisualization
Using the fltk library I've created a window in order to visualize sorting of flights. 
The user enters the name of the file containing data about flights, the type of sort to be user (QuickSort or Selection sort), 
the criteria by which flights are sorted(destination, origin...). After the user reads the data from input file he can hit the sort button,
afterwards the current layout of flights will be displayed. By hitting the next iteration the previous and current layout of flights will be shown
until they're completely sorted. The user can also select an output file to which the data will be printed.
